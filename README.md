NOT ALL HEROES WEAR CAPES BY IAN REYES

NAHWC is a creative twist on traditional fighing games. Where most fighting games feature some type of superhero or being with supernatural powers, NAHWC embraces the real superheroes in our society. NAHWC is features relatively simple controls, with an "easy to learn, hard to master" style of gameplay with quick rounds.

For this project, I used LOVE2D, an open source lua framework for creating 2d applications.

For this project, my biggest hurdles were the intricate frame data and the lengthy art process. Finding the sweet spot for each move was very difficult and took lots of trial and error. This took up a good chunk of my time- longer than creating the engine itself. The longest part of this project was the art. Creating and detailing each animation was easily the most time-consuming part of the project. Matching each animation to the hitboxes I created with the engine was a tedious task.

Overall, NAHWC was a very fun project to make. I've never made a serious fighting game before, and it was interesting to see how developers think when designing multiplayer games.
